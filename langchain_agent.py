Optional LangChain-based agent entrypoint.

This module demonstrates how you might wrap the browser driver,
language models and recovery logic into a LangChain agent. The goal is
to provide a high-level API for issuing natural language commands such
as "Apply to all Easy Apply Python backend jobs in the U.S.". At this
stage the implementation is a placeholder and will need significant
work to be functional.
