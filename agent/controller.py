"""
Controller for applying to a single job using LinkedIn Easy Apply.

This module defines the main loop that coordinates the browser, local LLM
and optional cloud LLM. It loads the job URL, triggers Easy Apply,
iterates through form steps and handles recovery when necessary. The
implementation is left as an exercise; the functions below define the
expected interface.

def apply_to_job(job_url: str, profile_path: str = "data/user_profile.yaml", use_cloud: bool = True) -> None:
    """Entry point for applying to a single job.

    Args:
        job_url: URL of the job posting to apply to.
        profile_path: Path to YAML file containing user profile.
        use_cloud: Whether to allow the fallback cloud model when the UI
            appears to be stuck. If False only the local model is used.

    The typical flow implemented by this function should be:

    1. Instantiate a ``BrowserDriver`` and load the job URL.
    2. Locate and click the Easy Apply button.
    3. Enter a loop that:
        a. Takes a snapshot of the current form step (buttons and inputs).
        b. Invokes ``LocalLLM.analyze`` with the snapshot and user profile.
        c. Executes the returned actions via ``BrowserDriver``.
        d. Breaks if ``is_final_step`` is True.
        e. Monitors for UI stalls and optionally invokes the cloud model via
           ``CloudLLM.analyze`` to recover.
    4. Logs the result (success or failure).

    The actual logic for loading the profile, building prompts, and
    interacting with the DOM is up to you. This scaffold exists so you
    can begin filling in the details.
