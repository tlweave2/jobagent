"""
Search controller for batch job applications.

This module coordinates the process of searching for jobs on LinkedIn
based on presets defined in ``data/linkedin_search.yaml``. It builds
search URLs, loads result pages, extracts job cards, filters them for
Easy Apply jobs and invokes the ``controller.apply_to_job`` function
for each job. The precise details of interacting with LinkedIn search
pages and detecting Easy Apply buttons are left for you to implement.

    """Search LinkedIn for jobs and apply to each one.

    Args:
        search_preset: A dictionary describing the desired job search. Keys
            might include ``title``, ``location``, ``easy_apply_only``,
            ``remote_only`` or any additional parameters you decide to
            support.
        profile_path: Path to YAML file containing user profile.

    The typical flow implemented by this function should be:

    1. Construct a search URL from ``search_preset`` via
       ``build_search_url``.
    2. Load the search page with the browser and extract job cards
       using ``extract_job_cards``.
    3. Filter the job cards for Easy Apply jobs.
    4. For each job card, call ``apply_to_job`` on the job URL.
    5. Optionally keep track of which jobs have been processed and
       skip previously applied jobs.
