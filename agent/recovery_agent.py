"""
Recovery agent for handling stalled user interfaces.

This module defines a simple interface for invoking a cloudâ€‘hosted
language model when the page appears to be stuck. The idea is that
you detect when the DOM stops changing (using logic in
``browser/dom_utils.py``), then call the cloud model to analyse the
current DOM and visible text and suggest recovery actions.

An instance of ``CloudLLM`` from ``models/cloud_llm.py`` is used to
generate those recovery actions. You could also implement heuristics
to recognise common modal dialogs without needing to invoke the model.
