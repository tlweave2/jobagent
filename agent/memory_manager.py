"""
Memory manager for job applications.

This optional module provides a way to track which jobs have been
applied to, store form field mappings and other metadata. In a full
implementation you might use SQLite for structured data and a vector
store for retrieval of similar forms. For this scaffold we define
placeholder methods that read and write JSON lines files.
