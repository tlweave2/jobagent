Extract job cards from LinkedIn search results.

When you load a LinkedIn jobs search page it contains a list of job
cards, each representing a single job listing. These cards include
links to the job detail page as well as metadata such as the job title,
company, location and whether it supports Easy Apply. This module
provides a placeholder function for parsing those cards using
Playwright. In a full implementation you would need to inspect the
page structure and select the appropriate elements.
