"""
Playwright driver abstraction.

This module wraps Playwright to provide methods for loading pages,
extracting DOM snapshots and executing actions. The goal is to
isolate all Playwright‑specific code from the rest of the agent so
that other parts of the system can work at a higher level of
abstraction.

The driver is intentionally skeletal; you'll need to fill in the
implementations using Playwright's API.
